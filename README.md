Smart Vision Quality Control System
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Smart Vision Quality Control System designed to automate the inspection of products in an ecommerce environment. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning technologies to analyze images of products and determine quality and quantity metrics.

Key Features:
Image Acquisition: Capture high-quality images using high-resolution cameras for product analysis.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Extract textual information such as expiration dates, product labels, and prices using Tesseract OCR.
Object Detection and Classification: Identify and classify products using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with models built using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Freshness Detection: Assess the quality and freshness of fresh produce based on visual cues (such as color, texture, and shape) using machine learning algorithms.
Automation Integration: Integrate with conveyor belts and robotic arms for automated sorting and handling of products based on quality control results.
